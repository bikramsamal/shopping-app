day after the Centre stalled the Delhi government's ambitious doorstep delivery of ration scheme, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday claimed that "legally", they don't need to seek the Centre's approval but the AAP government did it out of courtesy.

Addressing the press, Kejriwal said the Centre stalled the doorstep delivery of ration scheme just two days before its implementation in Delhi by claiming that the city government did not take prior approval of the scheme's rollout. "We took approval not just once, but five times. Legally, we don't need the Centre's approval but we did so out of courtesy," the CM said.
